# RSBot 8 Scripting Tutorials

This repo will contain all the code related to our tutorial project. The tutorial series teaches you how to go from absolutely 0 programming knowledge to a hopefully somewhat proficient Java programmer - at the very least, if you follow these tutorials you'll learn enough to create scripts for RSBot! 

## Interested? 

You can find the list of tutorials [here](https://www.powerbot.org/community/forum/389-scripting-tutorials/).

## How do I use this code?

Well, to be honest unless you're following the tutorials you shouldn't. If you are following the tutorials but messed something up and want to quickly replace yours with mine then you can download the zip file [here](https://github.com/ChrisBPB/NewTutorials.git), this should go into your src folder.
